## Special Matrices

In this section, we will cover different types of matrices and algorithms for them.

There are eight different types of matrices covered in this course:

1. Diagonal matrix
2. Lower Triangular Matrix
3. Upper Triangular Matrix
4. Symmetric Matrix
5. Tridiagonal Matrix
6. Band Matrix
7. Toeplitz Matrix
8. Sparse Matrix

#### Diagonal Matrix

- In this form of matrix, the only non-zero values are when i = j.
- This means that rather than computing and storing 2D arrays, diagonal matrices can be stored as a simple array.
