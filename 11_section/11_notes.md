  - What is a node
  - Node structure
  - How to create a node
  - How to access a node

#### Improving Linear Search in a Linked List

- Binary search in a linked list is not possible.
- Linear search takes O(N) time.
- But, searching through a linked list can be optimised by using transposition or move-to-head methods learned previously.
- In move to head, the node being searched will be made the head of the LL.
- If the same value is searched again, then the operation would be done in O(1) time.
