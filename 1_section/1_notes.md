1. Arrays
2. Matrices
3. Linked list
4. Stack
5. Queue
6. Trees
7. Graphs
8. Hashing

Algorithms and concepts that will be covered in this course:
1. Recursion
2. Sorting algorithms

### Video 2 Notes

- Data structures are essentially different ways to organise data in the memory of a computer.
- The context determines which algorithm is the best for a given requirement.
- Arrays, matrices and LLs are known as physical data structures.
  - They define how the data is arranged in memory.
- The rest of the data structures are known as logical DS'.
  - They define how the data can be utilised.
- The algorithms covered in this course are those that are applied directly to the DS' that are covered.
- Recursion is the first topic covered as it is essential for understanding problem-solving techniques applied when solving problems using programming.
